# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch
This repository aims to manually build some of the most popular machine learning techniques.
Each of which will be composed by the code implementation, some use case examples, and some little documentation of the followed approach.

> [!WARNING]
The primary aim of this repository is to develop machine learning algorithms from scratch. Therefore, the objective of the use cases is to show how to implement them, rather than to obtain the most performant one.
