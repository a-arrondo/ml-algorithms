# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch
This repository aims to manually build some of the most popular machine learning techniques.
Each of which will be composed by the code implementation, some use case examples, and some little documentation of the followed approach.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Thiis repository primarilly aims to implement machiine learning algorithms from scratch. Therefore, the objective of the use cases is to show how to implement the algorithm, rather than obtaining the best performant one.
